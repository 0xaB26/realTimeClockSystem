This project demonstrates how to interface a MAX6902 Real-Time Clock (RTC) with a PIC18F452 microcontroller to display the current time and date on a 20x2 LCD.

time and date displayed on lcd return to the time of testing, so you can change time and date by modifying clockWriteValues.

check the video.
