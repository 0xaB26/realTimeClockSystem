### DATE & TIME SYSTEM : 
This system allows users to view the current time and date in either English or French.
Users can select their preferred language, and the system will display the time and date formatted accordingly. The system uses a real-time clock (RTC).
The language selection is done by a potentiometer, the validation is done by a push button.
